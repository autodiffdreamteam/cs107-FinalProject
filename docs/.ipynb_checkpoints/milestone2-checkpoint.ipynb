    "## Differentiation \n",
    "Differentiation is one of the most commonly used mathematical operations. Fundamentally, it computes the rate of change of a variable with respect to another. This rate is referred to as the derivative of the first variable with respect to the second. Differentiation generalizes from single to multi-valued functions, for which we can compute derivatives with respect to one or more dependent variables. Values of these derivatives serve as critical inputs to many numerical algorithms (e.g. Newton's method). Given the rapid growth of complexity in modern computational problems, it is imperative to compute these derivatives both quickly and accurately. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Automatic differentiation (AD)\n",
    "Automatic Differentiation (abbreviation: AD and also referred to as Algorithmic or Computational Differentiation) is a method to evaluate derivatives of real-valued functions. It is a variant of the classically conceptualized computer-based differentiation methods such as symbolic differentation and finite difference methods but addresses shortcomings encountered in both. For example, symbolic differentation possesses the capability to compute derivatives to machine precision, however the required computational times can be quite large. On the other hand, finite difference differentiation is quicker but produces errors in the computed derivatives that are several order of magnitudes higher than machine precision. AD emerges as a solution devoid of shortcomings observed in both symbolic and finite difference methods and hence is gaining popularity in computational scientific applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications of automatic differentiation\n",
    "Automatic differentiation can be applied to many important computational problems. Examples include root finding methods such as the Newton's method, optimization schemes such as the Gradient Descent method, and machine learning algorithms such as the backpropagation algorithm. All these methods have a critical dependence on fast and accurate computation of derivates. Automatic differentiation serves these requirements and hence is an appropriate choice for calculating the derivatives for these algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The gradient descent method (GDM)\n",
    "The Gradient Descent Method (GDM) is an iterative optimization algorithm. It can be used to find local minima of a differentiable function by iteratively miniminizing a cost function and ultimately stopping at the minimum value of the cost function, which indicates a local minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1-D the following steps are performed in GDM.\n",
    "**Step 1**: Given a function in $x$, start at a random point $x_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: Compute the derivative at $x_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: Check if the algorithm is going in the right direction based on the sign of the derivative or if it has reached the minimum\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4**: Get a new value of $x$ and repeat Steps 1-3 until convergence to a local minimum\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be extended to higher dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "The software package presented here provides a computational tool to compute derivatives of multi-valued functions employing the AD technique. The package will compute derivatives using forward AD method. In addition, it will enable optimization using the GDM. \n",

    "\n",
    "## The chain rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentitation is built upon the chain rule, which provides a formula to compute the derivative of composite functions. Recall that if we have a composite function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(g(h(x))), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "the chain rule tells us that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial g} \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial h}\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this package, we implement the forward mode of AD, whereby we evaluate the derivative of a composite function from the inside out. Put differently, we differentiate with respect to one independent variable and recursively find the derivative of each sub-expression starting with the innermost function. In general, the forward mode would evaluate the derivative above as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_{n-1}} \\frac{\\partial v_{n-1}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_{n-1}}  \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_{n-1}}{\\partial v_{n-2}}\\frac{\\partial v_{n-2}}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_{n-1}} \\frac{\\partial v_{n-1}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_{n-1}}  \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_{n-1}}{\\partial v_{n-2}} \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_{n-2}}{\\partial v_{n-3}} \\frac{\\partial v_{n-3}}{\\partial x} \\right) \\right) = ..., $$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ f = f(g(x), h(x)), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "the derivative becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla_x f = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial g} \\nabla g + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial h} \\nabla h. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting this all together, we can use the chain rule to express the derivative of a general vector-valued function $ f=f(y(x)) $ where $ y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n $ and $ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m $ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\nabla_x f = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y_i} \\nabla y_i(x). $$\n",

    "## The computational graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the function $ f(x, y) = e^{x^2 + y^2}. $ For illustrative purposes, we can summarize the recursive operations of forward mode AD in a computational graph. \n",

    "# Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current implementation of `AutoDiffPy` makes use of a broad range of data structures, including: \n",
    "- `NumPy` arrays for optimized storage and fast retrieval of data \n",
    "- Tuples to conveniently store pairs of values, for example `(f.val, f.der)` \n",
    "- Dictionaries, for example to map elementary function strings (e.g. `\"sin\"`) to class functions (e.g. `self.sin`)\n",

    "`AutoDiffPy` can now be constructed in two different ways, based on the optional `input_function` parameter in the `__init__` dunder method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 1**: Use the `val` and optionally the `der` parameters.\n",
    "This option allows for broadly the most flexible usage and allows users to access the elementary operations and mathematical functions built into the `AutoDiffPy` class. For example, the user could print out the value and the derivative of $f(x) = \\cos(\\sin(x))$ at $x=2.0$ simply by doing:\n",

    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Option 2**: Use the optional `input_function` parameter.\n",
    "The second, more exciting approach (which we belive sets our AD library apart from others), is to pass a function string to the optional `input_function` parameter, which enables the user to evaluate the derivative of complex functions without having to construct those functions manually, as shown above. The example above then becomes:\n",

    "# Future features\n",
    "While our current implementation works for a broad range of use cases, there are a number of logical extensions to `AutoDiffPy` that we will be pursuing in future milestones. These include:\n",
    "1. Enable vector-valued function inputs: \n",
    "    - In the next milestone, we plan on implementing forward mode AD with vector-valued functions.\n",
    "    - As we did in this milestone, we plan on providing users with the option of construction those functions manually, or by using the `input_function` function, which will ultimately be able to identify the number of variables, decide whether it is a vector, and parse it appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make the `input_function` more flexible: as seen in the `input_function` syntax section, our current implementation of `parse_input` is somewhat rigid in places. In the next milestone, we plan on allowing for \n",
    "    - parentheses within the center polynomial,\n",
    "    - power outside of parentheses, and\n",
    "    - operations between functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Implement the `GradDescPy` class:\n",
    "    - To increase the usefulness of our `ad_library`, we will eventually implement a class that uses the `AutoDiffPy` class to perform gradient descent.\n",
    "    - We plan on achieving consistency between the structure of `AutoDiffPy` and `GradDescPy` so that these two classes work well in tandem. In particular, we hope that the `input_function` option within `AutoDiffPy` will allow users to seamlessly type in a function and easily perform an optimization on it.\n",
    "    - As we did in `AutoDiffPy`, we will strive to ask the user for minimal inputs, abstracting the interface as necessary."
